The AMD OpenGL ES SDK is a set of libraries and headers that developers can
use to create 3D graphics applications using the OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0/3.1 API
natively on microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. OpenGL ES 2.0 or 
3.0/3.1 is a subset of the full OpenGL specification, but provides a smaller, 
lightweight API, limited to the core functionality required to support fully 
programmable 3D graphics, without the overhead of legacy features. With this 
SDK, AMD provides fully compliant native support for OpenGL ES 2 or 3.0/3.1 
and EGL on systems running AMD Radeon HD and AMD FirePro graphics cards.
